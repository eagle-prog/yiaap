    <h1 class="list-h2">Who we are</h1>
    <p>We're Yiaap - the best, decentralized, online video community. Thank you for using the Yiaap platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as part of the platform (collectively, the “Service”). </p>
    
    <p>The entity providing the Service is INvesprise LLC, a company operating under the laws of Pennsylvania(referred to as “Yiaap”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). References to Yiaap’s “Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group (now or in the future).
 </p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">What information we collect</h1>
    <p>The Service allows you to discover, watch and share videos and other content, provides a forum for people to connect, inform, and inspire others across the globe, and acts as a distribution platform for original content creators and advertisers large and small. We provide lots of information about our products and how to use them in our Help Center. Among other things, you can find out about Yiaap Kids, the Yiaap Partner Program and Yiaap Paid Memberships and Purchases (where available).You can also read all about enjoying content on other devices like your television, your games console, or Yiaap Home.</p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">How we use personal information</h1>
    <p>The content on the Service includes videos, audio (for example music and other sounds), graphics, photos, text (such as comments and scripts), branding (including trade names, trademarks, service marks, or logos), interactive features, software, metrics, and other materials whether provided by you, Yiaap or a third-party (collectively, "Content”).

Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to the Service. Yiaap is under no obligation to host or serve Content. If you see any Content you believe does not comply with this Agreement, including by violating the Community Guidelines or the law, you can report it to us.

</p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">What legal grounds we have for processing your personal data</h1>
    <p>Just as any other business, operating with the laws of the USA and a motive to make a profit</p>
    
    
     <h1 class="list-h2">What about privacy</h1>
    <p>With so much exposure, privacy naturally becomes a factor, and those who feel their privacy has been violated can file a privacy complaint directly with the service.
</p>
    
    
     <h1 class="list-h2">Written consent does not necessarily make a difference</h1>
    <p>Here's a hypothetical: The uploader has written consent or verbal proof that the individual in question has given permission to have their presence uploaded on Yiaap. Now what? Yiaap's website explains that even with this information, the content must still be taken off the platform. "Unfortunately we cannot accept or review agreements granting consent before the video was uploaded," writes Yiaap. "Thus, we may still have to remove your video based upon the complaint." </p>
    
    
    <h1 class="list-h2">Yiaap's privacy policy is consistent across the globe</h1>
    <p>Privacy laws vary from country to country, but Yiaap's privacy guidelines are constant regardless of an individual nation's rules. "Our privacy guidelines apply to all users across the world," writes Yiaap. "In other words, while the video in question may not violate your country's privacy laws, it may still violate Yiaap's privacy guidelines." </p>
    
   <h1 class="list-h2">Filing a complaint is anonymous</h1>
    <p> According to Yiaap, the identity or contact information of someone initiating a privacy complaint process will not be disclosed to the uploader of the video. In most cases, complaints must be first-party claims and not on behalf of someone else.</p>
    
    <h1 class="list-h2">Yiaap won't remove the video within the first two weeks</h1>
    <p>Once a complaint has been filed, the uploader is notified and has 48 hours to remove the video in question. Should they not remove the content, a team at Yiaap reviews the complaint. </p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">When do we share personal data</h1>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Service. The Yiaap Kids Privacy Notice provides additional information about our privacy practices that are specific to Yiaap Kids.

We will process any audio or audiovisual content uploaded by you to the Service in accordance with the Yiaap Data Processing Terms, except in cases where you uploaded such content for personal purposes or household activities.
</p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">Right to Monetize</h1>
    <p>You grant to Yiaap the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting November 18, 2020, any payments you may be entitled to receive from Yiaap under any other agreement between you and Yiaap (including for example payments under the Yiaap Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  If required by law, Yiaap will withhold taxes from such payments.</p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">Removing Your Content</h1>
    <p>You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.
</p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">How long we keep personal data stored for</h1>
    <p>For as long as you are compliant with our terms of service and the laws of the United States of America</p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">Your rights in relation to personal data</h1>
    <p>As soon as you have uploaded your content to our platform, we are co-sharing the content by reason of providing a platform and a service</p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">Use of automated decision-making and profiling</h1>
    <p>Profiling is illegal in many states in USA. We don't profile. We don't track users. Just stay compliant with our TOS and follow the laws of the land.</p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">Contacting us</h1>
    <p>You can contact us at: admin@yiaap.com</p>
    <h1 class="list-h2">Usage of cookies or other technologies</h1>
    <p>We don't need to store your data because we don't track users, now or ever will.</p>
